Part one is simple. I just need to walk the
path and place Xs where they dont exist.

Part two.

This in my mind is more difficult, but I think I have
a possible solution:

1. Walk the path as normal
2. Instead of leaving Xs, leave a direction
3. Once we come across a cell that's already been visited,
we check the direction that we were last moving.
    - If that previous direction is 90 degrees to the right,
    this is a possible spot for a new obstacle to cause a loop.

already seeing a possible hiccup in this plan

....#.....
....+---+#
....|...|.
..#.|...|.
..+-+-+#|.
..|.|.|.|.
.#+-^-+-+.
..|...|.#.
#O+---+...
......#...

this loop would not be detected.

So maybe instead of leaving a direction in just the places I've visited,
I can leave a direction in every cell behind me as well. Then I just
stop when I reach an obstacle behind me.

This will result in a lot of work being done twice, but
I think it may work.


this is quickly getting out of hand.
Simpler solution:

just place an obstacle at every step, then check for
looping.

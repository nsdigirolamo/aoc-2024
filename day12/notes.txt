part one:

idea:

First, create an "empty" garden that's the same
size as the real garden.

Next, iterate over each plot of the garden. If the
plot is empty in our "empty" garden, start recursively
looking for neighbors and track area and perimeter at the
same time.

For each visited plot in the recursive search, fill that
spot in the empty garden

after the recursive search is complete, add the calculated
price to the total

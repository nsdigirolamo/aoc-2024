X|Y
if page X and Y are produced as part of an update,
X must be printed before Y

each line of input is an update, with the pages
in the order of which they were printed

start by identifying which updates are already in the right order.

A rule only applies if both page numbers are part of the update.

determine which updates are already in the correct order, then add
their middle page numbers

brainstorm solution to part 1:

assemble the rules into a map.

key: a page number
value: tuple[set[int], set[int]]

where the first set of the tuple are the numbers that must come
before the key page number

and the second set of the tuple are the numbers that must come
after the key page number

for each page number in an update, check behind and in front
of the page and apply the rules.

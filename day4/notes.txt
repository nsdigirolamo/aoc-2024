Pretty straight forward.

We have a 2x2 grid full of characters and need
to find all the valid ocurrences of xmas.

possible combinations:

XMAS
SAMX

X S
M A
A M
S X

X       X S       S
 M     M   A     A
  A   A     M   M
   S S       X X

So there are 8 combinations of XMAS.
I can just iterate through every element
and check against these 8 configurations
